Aim of our project is to create a ML based Software Application that intelligently identifies
the patterns in the given Image and converts it into a one line description in the form of TEXT.
It Predicts the results on the basis of the patterns it haslearnt during its Training phase.

### Target audience

- Color blind people who can't recognize color of object in front of them
- People who don't know the object in front of them
